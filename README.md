# Capstone_Project_AIRBNB_Price_Prediction

Introduction
The Airbnb rental price prediction project aims to develop a predictive model to assist hosts in setting competitive yet profitable prices and empower guests in making informed booking decisions. Accurate pricing is crucial for user satisfaction and the success of hosts on the dynamic Airbnb marketplace. Leveraging data science and machine learning, the project addresses the challenges hosts face in pricing their listings accurately, contributing to the overall growth and success of Airbnb. The industry recognizes the importance of data-driven decision-making, technological solutions, and continuous innovation in the field of short-term rentals.


Background Research
In the realm of short-term rentals, accurate pricing is pivotal for both hosts and guests on Airbnb. Leveraging data science and machine learning, predictive models offer hosts the ability to optimize revenue while ensuring fair pricing for guests. This technology-driven approach addresses the challenges of dynamic marketplaces and enhances the overall user experience.


Current practices
1. Data Gathering and Cleaning: Collect data from credit loan datasets and clean it to handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data, identify patterns, and formulate hypotheses using various visualization techniques.
3. Feature Engineering and Selection: Create and select the most relevant features to improve the model's performance.
4. Statistical Prediction: Apply statistical models like linear regression or logistic regression to make predictions about loan default probabilities.
5. Machine Learning Models: Apply machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks to predict loan defaults.
